# MVU-Minimum-variance-unbiased-estimator-problems-and-matlab-code
In this repository we see MVU(Minimum-variance unbiased) estimator problems and matlab code
These are some part of K.N.Toosi university of Technology Large-Scale systems assignments(HW1)
Sorry that  I Didn't have time to translate the problems into English.
The pdf file Large scale HW#1 explains the process step-by-step.
But the matlab codes could be really informative!
1.1) First problem asks us to design LQR controllers (centralized and Decentralized)
1.2) Design LQR controller for G11 and G22 separately  
1.3)Calculate the state response of the system to initial conditions 0.5 for all states and plot the control signal.
1.4) Using the control criterion(cost function given in the question) compare the first and second partsâ€™ performances
Problem 2)
2.1) Determine if the system is controllable and Observable
2.2) LQR Controller Design using Q and R matrices in order to stabilize the system.
And so on:)
